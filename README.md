# Digita_Communications-
Hello, Iâ€™m Omar a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student exploring how data is encoded, transmitted, and understood. This project showcases my journey through Digital Communications. From RLE compression and channel coding to modulation and data analysis. turning complex theory into working code.

My Understanding of the Project:

This CA will focus on designing and developing a Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression program in C. While the task might appear straightforward at first, the real goal will be to understand how data can be represented more efficiently and how the ideas from digital communications can be applied in real programming work.

RLE will operate by checking how many times a character repeats in a sequence and then replacing that repetition with the character and the number of times it appears. For example, the text

AAAAA BB CC DD  
A5    B2 C2 D2
